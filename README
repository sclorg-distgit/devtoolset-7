Package %{scl_name} is the main package for Red Hat Developer
Toolset 4.  By installing the %{scl_name} package, you will get
the working set of packages that are included in Red Hat Developer
Toolset 4.  It is possible to install only certain components,
such as an IDE or the toolchain packages used to develop and debug
applications, since this package contains a number of meta packages.
These are: %{scl_name}-ide, which includes Integrated Development
Environment; %{scl_name}-perftools, which includes performance
monitoring tools; and %{scl_name}-toolchain, which includes
development and debugging tools.

Usage: scl enable %{scl} <command>

Red Hat Developer Toolset allows you to build and execute applications
which are not located in the filesystem root hierarchy, but are
stored in an alternative location, which is %{_scl_root} in case
of the %{scl_name} collection.
